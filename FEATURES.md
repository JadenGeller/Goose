# Features

What follows is a list of features that I'd like to learn how to implement. They range from entirely fundamental features (closer to the beginning of the list) to very advanced features (closer to the end of the list). It's impossible that I'll be able to implement all of these features in a single term, so I'll prioritize the more fundamental ones.
