# Milestones

The following milestones are those which I believe are important to successfully completing this project.
They are inspired by [features](FEATURES.md) I'd like to include in this language. Each week will include a high-level goal,
and I will work to implement features relevant to that goal.

Since there are approximately 7 weeks to work on this project before graduation, I've assigned myself 5 major topics that
I'd like to focus on. The extra weeks will act as a buffer in case something takes longer than I expect.

Note that I don't necessarily require that I complete all sub-bullets of these topics; instead, these milestones are to
ensure I properly budget my time so I don't get caught up in unimportant features.

1) Implementing basic depedently-typed lambda calculus
   - ABT
   - type-system
   - interpreter
2) Extending the langauge
   - forms of equality
   - simple data types
   - basic control flow
3) Improving datatypes
   - parameterized types
   - indexed types
   - pattern matching
4) Front-end
   - syntax
   - error reporting
   - unix command-line app
5) Further advancements
   - universes
   - type-erasure
   - implicit arguments
   - termination analysis
  
Each week, I'll be writing about my [progress](PROGRESS.md) with respect to the milestone.
